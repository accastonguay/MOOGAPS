# MOOGAPS

MOO-GAPS (**M**ulti-**O**bjective **O**ptimisation of **G**lobal **A**gricultural **P**roduction and **S**ustainability) is a multi-objective high resolution spatial optimisation model that seeks to find the most efficient locations and feeds to produce beef with the lowest possible production costs and GHG emissions.
It is open source and fully written in Python. It can simulate the current enoconomic costs of production and greenhouse gas emissions from beef globally, as well as find the most efficient locations to produce feed using a weighted sum optimisation.
