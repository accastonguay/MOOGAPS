# MOOGAPS

MOO-GAPS (**M**ulti-**O**bjective **O**ptimisation of **G**lobal **A**nimal **P**roduction and **S**ustainability) is a multi-objective high resolution spatial optimisation model that seeks to find the most efficient locations and feeds to produce animal-source food given multiple sustainability objectives.
It is open source and written in Python. It is currently configured to minimise enoconomic costs of production and greenhouse gas emissions from beef production. Further developments will include dairy cattle, small ruminants (goats and sheep), pigs and poultry, and additional sustainability objectives, e.g., reduction of biodiversity loss and food security.

<!-- ## Shiny App
Results for the optimisation can be explored and visualised through a Shiny app:
